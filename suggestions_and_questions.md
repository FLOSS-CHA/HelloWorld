1. @vendion, could you post the GITHUB URL to the presentation slides here?

  The slides from the previous meetup can be found at https://gitlab.com/vendion/talks/tree/master/floss-2018-01-18

2. GitHub/GIT - question: Are there some good cheat sheets you could recommend for overcoming Newbie issues?
 > example: Sometimes changes happen that cause GitHub to fail to sync
 >          and it asks the user to open up a CMD session to diagnose the issue.

 This is a pretty good cheat sheet for getting started https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/
 I have a less formatted one in my config file repo at
